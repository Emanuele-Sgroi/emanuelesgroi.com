# 🚧 WORK IN PROGRESS 🚧

Welcome to what will soon be my personal website, inspired by the clean, minimalistic design of GitHub. Instead of spending countless hours on a futuristic, over-the-top design, I’ve opted for something simple and functional—just what I need for a portfolio. After all, I’d rather focus my time on **cool projects** that actually matter, rather than my own website that only a handful of people might ever visit! ☹️

Stay tuned for updates! 🚀
